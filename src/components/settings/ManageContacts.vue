        <p>The people listed here are contacts you've uploaded to Instagram. To remove your synced contacts, tap Delete All. Your contacts will be re-uploaded the next time Instagram syncs your contacts unless you go to your device settings and turn off access to contacts.</p>
        <p>Only you can see your contacts, but Instagram uses the info you've uploaded about your contacts to make friend suggestions for you and others and to provide a better experience for everyone.</p>
